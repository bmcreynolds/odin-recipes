        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3lbs beef chuck roast</li>

        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Heavily salt the beef up to 24 hours in advance. The salt absorbs into the meat, so the longer the wait the more salt you can use</li>
            <li>Julienne the onions and mince the garlic</li>
            <li>Clean off any extra salt from the waiting Beef</li>
            <li>Cut the beef into 4-6 chunks</li>
            <li>Season the beef with salt, pepper, chili powder, and whatever else. I like to use lime adobo seasoning</li>
            <li>Oil the instant pot and set to saute</li>
            <li>Saute the beef chunks until all side have a nice brown crust</li>
            <li>Add the onions to the instant pot and saute until they're soft and starting to brown</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and saute the onions and garlic until fragrant and soft</li>
            <li>Add 2 cups of beef broth the the pot, breaking up and disolving any fond</li>
